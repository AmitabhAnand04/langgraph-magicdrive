Verify that your email attachment was sent to the correct data ingestion email address. 2. Check that the file format is supported (CSV, Excel, XML, EDI). 3. Ensure the file size doesn't exceed 50MB limit. 4. Wait up to 30 minutes for processing - large files may take time for data mapping and transformation. 5. Check the Data Ingestion Status page under Settings to see if there are any processing errors. 6. If the issue persists, contact support with the original filename and timestamp of when you sent the email.\"\nThe broker performance scorecard is showing incorrect on-time performance percentages,performance_metrics,\"1. Navigate to Settings > Data Configuration and verify your delivery window settings match your broker agreements. 2. Check that the timestamp fields (Origin Close Date/Time and Destination Open Date/Time) are being mapped correctly from your broker's data. 3. Review the Lane Performance Dashboard to identify if specific lanes are affecting the overall calculation. 4. Ensure your broker is providing complete timestamp data - missing timestamps can skew calculations. 5. Use the Shipment Detail View to manually verify a few shipments to confirm the calculations. 6. If discrepancies persist, export the raw data and contact support for a detailed review.\"\nLane price predictions are showing very low confidence scores,predictive_analytics,\"1. Check that you have at least 6 months of historical data for the specific lane - more data improves prediction accuracy. 2. Verify that your shipment data includes all required fields: origin, destination, load type, vehicle type, and actual costs. 3. Review if the lane has sufficient volume (minimum 20-30 shipments) for reliable predictions. 4. Consider seasonal variations - some lanes may have inherently variable pricing. 5. Check the Feature Importance section to see which factors are missing or inconsistent. 6. Use the Anomaly Detection feature to identify and exclude outlier shipments that might be affecting the model. 7. Contact support to review your specific lane's data quality and model parameters.\"\nI cannot export my custom reports to Excel format,reporting,\"1. Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions). 2. Check that pop-up blockers are disabled for the Truce domain. 3. Verify you have sufficient browser storage and clear cache if needed. 4. Try reducing the date range or applying additional filters to limit the report size (maximum 100,000 rows for Excel export). 5. Check your browser's download settings and ensure downloads aren't being blocked. 6. Try using CSV export as an alternative - it handles larger datasets better. 7. If you need the specific Excel formatting, contact support to process the export server-side.\"\nMy broker integration via FTP is not working and files are not being processed,data_ingestion,\"1. Verify your FTP credentials and server settings with your IT team. 2. Check that you're connecting to the correct Truce FTP server address and port. 3. Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections on the required FTP ports (21, 990, or custom port provided). 4. Test the connection using a standard FTP client first. 5. Verify file naming conventions match the requirements (broker_id_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv). 6. Check that files are being placed in the correct directory structure. 7. Monitor the FTP connection logs in your Data Sources settings. 8. Contact your network administrator to ensure no security policies are blocking the connection.\"\nTransit time predictions are consistently inaccurate for my reefer loads,predictive_analytics,\"1. Verify that reefer loads are properly tagged with the correct vehicle type in your broker data. 2. Check if temperature-controlled loads have different routing patterns that aren't captured in the base model. 3. Review your historical reefer data for accuracy - ensure Origin/Destination timestamps are correct. 4. Consider seasonal factors - reefer loads may have different transit patterns during peak seasons. 5. Use the Slice and Dice feature to analyze reefer performance separately from dry van loads. 6. Check if your broker provides additional reefer-specific data points (temperature requirements, special handling) that could improve predictions. 7. Contact support to review reefer-specific model parameters and potentially create a specialized prediction model.\"\nDashboard is loading very slowly and sometimes times out,performance,\"1.

Check your internet connection speed and stability. 2. Try reducing the date range on your dashboard widgets (recommend 90 days max for optimal performance). 3. Close other browser tabs and applications that might be consuming memory. 4. Clear your browser cache and cookies for the Truce domain. 5. Try using a different browser or incognito/private mode. 6. Reduce the number of widgets displayed on your dashboard simultaneously. 7. Use the drill-down capabilities instead of loading all data at once. 8. If problems persist during specific hours, this may indicate high system usage - try accessing during off-peak hours or contact support about performance optimization.\"\nI'm not receiving alert notifications for delayed shipments,alerts_notifications,1. Check your notification settings under User Profile > Alert Preferences. 2. Verify that your email address is correct and confirmed. 3. Check your email spam/junk folder - add noreply@truce.com to your safe senders list. 4. Review your alert criteria - ensure the delay threshold is appropriate (not too high). 5. Confirm that the shipments in question actually meet your alert criteria. 6. Test the notification system by setting up a simple test alert with broad criteria. 7. Check if your organization's email server is blocking automated emails. 8. Try enabling SMS notifications as a backup option. 9.
